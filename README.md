# Scalatroids

This is a quick Asteroids clone I made using only pencil drawn assets. 

The purpose of the project was to give me practice writing Scala applications, and help beat the winter blues.

You can look at the demo here: [https://michelcarroll.github.io/scalatroids/demo.html](https://michelcarroll.github.io/scalatroids/demo.html)
